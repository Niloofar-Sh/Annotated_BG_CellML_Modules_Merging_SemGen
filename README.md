# Annotated_BG_CellML_Modules_Merging_SemGen
Four vessels were modeled individually in CellML in terms of Bond Graphs: 
1) aortic_root_module => 2) ascending_aorta_module => 3) aortic_arch_I_module
                                                   => 4) brachiocephalic_module
                                                   
The whole manually composed model of these four vessels is provided in "Aortic Arch_BG.cellml".

Then each module was annotated and merged with the rest in SemGen ("Final_merged_SemGen.cellml").

The fluid flow rate in each vessel was plotted and compared with the one in the manually composed model which both gave the same results.
